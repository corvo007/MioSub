# Video Promo Planning

## Overview

A data-driven workflow for planning software product promotional videos targeting B站 and YouTube. Based on creator best practices and platform algorithm insights.

## When to Use

- User wants to create a promotional video for their software
- User asks about video style, structure, or script
- User needs help with video title/thumbnail ideas
- User mentions "B站", "YouTube", "视频宣传", "产品演示"

## Critical Statistics to Remember

| Metric                | Data                                        | Source                |

| Silent viewing        | **83%** watch with sound off                | Platform analytics    |
| Caption impact        | **80%** more likely to finish with captions | Accessibility studies |

| Short demo sweet spot | **30-60 seconds** for product demos         | Product Hunt data     |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery Questions

Ask the user:

1. **Product type** - Developer tool or consumer app?
2. **Target audience** - Who will watch this video?
3. **Core value proposition** - What problem does it solve? (one sentence)
4. **Key features** - Top 3-5 features to highlight
5. **Differentiators** - What makes it unique vs competitors?
6. **"Aha moment"** - What's the single most impressive thing to show?

### Phase 2: Style Recommendation

| Style                        | Best For                          | Characteristics                         |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Screen Recording + Narration | Developer tools, complex features | Direct, efficient, shows real usage     |
| Motion Graphics              | Consumer apps, brand awareness    | Polished, engaging, highlights benefits |
| Scenario Story               | Lifestyle apps, emotional appeal  | Relatable, shows transformation         |
| Hybrid                       | Feature-rich products             | Combines demo with storytelling         |

**Platform DNA:**

- **B站**: Depth over speed, personality matters, 弹幕 interaction, longer acceptable (10-15 min)
- **YouTube**: Hook-first, SEO-conscious, faster pacing, Shorts for discovery

### Phase 3: Duration Planning

| Video Type        | B站       | YouTube  | Notes                      |
| ----------------- | --------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| Quick Demo        | 3-5 min   | 2-3 min  | Single feature, fast value |
| Full Introduction | 8-12 min  | 5-8 min  | Complete overview          |
| Tutorial          | 10-15 min | 8-12 min | Step-by-step guide         |
| Story-driven      | 5-8 min   | 3-5 min  | Emotional narrative        |
| Shorts/竖屏       | <3 min    | <60 sec  | Hook → Value → CTA         |

**Golden rule**: Content density > raw length. Cut ruthlessly.

### Phase 4: Hook Design (CRITICAL)

**The first 3 seconds are a verdict, not an introduction.**

The viewer's brain asks three instant questions:

1. Is this clear?
2. Is this relevant?
3. Is something happening RIGHT NOW?

If any answer is "no", the thumb wins. You have 5-10 seconds max to prove value.

**Hook Types:**

| Type          | Formula                                | Example                             |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Negative Bias | "Stop doing X if you want Y"           | "别再手动加字幕了，如果你想..."     |
| Story Tease   | "I almost lost everything when..."     | "我差点因为字幕问题丢掉这个项目..." |
| Bold Claim    | "Everything you know about X is wrong" | "你对字幕工具的认知可能完全错了"    |
| Result First  | Show impressive outcome immediately    | [展示完美字幕效果] "这只用了3分钟"  |
| Problem Pain  | Relatable frustration                  | "字幕翻译要花3小时？我懂那种痛苦"   |

**Micro-Hooks (信号，不是句子):**

Micro-hooks are signals, not sentences. They trigger instant attention:

- **Unexpected movement** - A sudden zoom, pan, or object entering frame
- **Strong contrast** - Visual or audio contrast that stands out
- **Frozen emotion** - Face frozen at peak emotional moment
- **Deliberate jump cut** - Intentional, not jarring
- **Sound spike** - Audio cue that breaks pattern

**Hook Techniques:**

1. **Pattern Interrupt** - Unexpected visual/sound in first 3 seconds (+23% retention)
2. **Open Loop** - Tease something coming later (+32% watch time)
3. **"What's in it for me?"** - State benefit within 10 seconds
4. **Show, Don't Tell** - Jump into action, skip "Hey guys, welcome back"
5. **Visual Rhythm** - Sequence of movement, cuts, and changes that sustains engagement

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**

- ❌ "大家好，欢迎来到我的频道..."
- ❌ Long channel intro/logo animation
- ❌ Explaining what you'll cover before showing value
- ✅ Start with the problem or result immediately

### Phase 5: Content Structure

**AIDA Framework for Software:**

```
1. ATTENTION (0:00-0:30) - THE HOOK
   - Pattern interrupt or bold claim
   - Show the "aha moment" immediately
   - State the core benefit

2. INTEREST (0:30-2:00) - THE PROMISE
   - Product introduction (brief)
   - Core value proposition
   - Quick demo of main feature
   - "By the end of this video, you'll be able to..."

3. DESIRE (2:00-6:00) - THE PROOF
   - Feature walkthrough (3-5 features max)
   - Each feature: Pain → Solution → Demo
   - Social proof if available
   - Address common objections

4. ACTION (last 30s) - THE ASK
   - Clear, specific CTA
   - Links and resources
   - Engagement ask (platform-specific)
```

**Alternative: PAS Framework (shorter videos)**

```
Problem (0:00-0:30) - Agitate the pain point
Agitate (0:30-1:30) - Make it worse, show consequences
Solution (1:30-end) - Your product as the hero
```

### Phase 6: Script Writing

**Script Template:**

```markdown
## [Section Name] (MM:SS-MM:SS)

**画面**: [What appears on screen - be specific]
**旁白**: [Narration text - conversational, short sentences]
**字幕**: [On-screen text/captions - 83% watch muted!]
**BGM**: [Music mood: upbeat/calm/dramatic/none]
**视觉效果**: [Zoom, highlight, transition notes]

[PAUSE] - Mark breathing points
[PATTERN BREAK] - Mark visual/audio changes

---
```

**Script Principles:**

1. **Conversational tone** - Write for speaking, Grade 6 reading level
2. **One idea per sentence** - Easy to follow when muted
3. **Show, don't tell** - Demo > description
4. **Pattern breaks every 5-10 seconds** - Reset attention
5. **Captions are mandatory** - 83% watch muted

**Voice Guidelines:**

- Speak like a builder, not a marketer
- Acknowledge tradeoffs honestly
- "This works great for X, but if you need Y, consider Z"
- Avoid: "unleash", "unlock", "game-changer", "revolutionary"

### Phase 7: Title & Thumbnail

**Thumbnail Design (10-20ms to decide):**

| Element     | Guideline                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Face        | Include if possible (11x more noticeable)  |
| Text        | 3 words MAX, large font, readable at 100px |
| Contrast    | High contrast colors, test at small size   |
| Emotion     | Curiosity, surprise, or transformation     |
| Consistency | Series recognition for returning viewers   |

**Title Formulas:**

| Formula                | B站 Example                       | YouTube Example                        |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| [Result] + [Tool]      | "10分钟生成专业字幕 - MioSub教程" | "Professional Subtitles in 10 Minutes" |
| [Problem] → [Solution] | "字幕翻译太慢？AI帮你搞定"        | "Slow Subtitle Translation? Try This"  |
| [Number] + [Benefit]   | "5个让效率翻倍的技巧"             | "5 Tips to Double Your Speed"          |
| [Comparison]           | "MioSub vs 传统工具：实测对比"    | "MioSub vs Traditional Tools: Tested"  |
| [How-to]               | "如何用AI自动生成双语字幕"        | "How to Auto-Generate Bilingual Subs"  |

**Title Rules:**

- Keywords at the beginning (SEO)
- Under 60 characters (YouTube) / 可以稍长 (B站)
- Include specific numbers or results
- Test 2-3 variations

### Phase 8: Output Deliverables

Provide the user with:

1. **策划方案** - Style, duration, platform strategy, hook approach
2. **内容大纲** - Section breakdown with timestamps
3. **完整脚本** - Full script with visual/audio notes
4. **标题选项** - 3-5 title variations per platform
5. **封面建议** - Thumbnail concept with specific elements

### Phase 9: Track & Iterate (Often Missed)

**"Knowing who watched, how long they watched, and where they dropped off makes the demo a real growth lever, not just a nice-to-have."**

After publishing, track:

| Metric             | What It Tells You             | Action                      |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Drop-off points    | Where viewers lose interest   | Tighten that section        |
| Completion rate    | Overall engagement            | Adjust length/pacing        |
| Click-through rate | Thumbnail/title effectiveness | A/B test variations         |
| Replay sections    | What viewers found valuable   | Double down on that content |
| Comments/弹幕      | Audience questions/confusion  | Address in next video       |

**Iteration cycle:**

1. Publish → Track performance for 7-14 days
2. Identify biggest drop-off point
3. Create improved version or follow-up addressing that gap
4. Test new thumbnail/title if CTR is low
5. Repeat

## Long-Term Strategy Notes

**MrBeast's Core Insight:**

> "If your motivation for grinding is so you can buy a nice car and maybe buy a nice house, you're not going to be one of the greats."

- **Passion-driven > Reward-driven** - Creators chasing improvement evolve; those chasing paydays plateau
- **Consistency is the competitive advantage** - "If I'm not filming, we're not putting out content"
- **Stop publishing = Stop existing** - In content creation, presence is everything

**Content compounds over time:**

- 40% of views happen after 30 days
- Build a library, not just campaigns
- Series > one-off videos
- Repurpose: Long-form → Shorts → 竖屏

**One Asset, Multiple Channels (复用策略):**

The same demo video works across:

- Landing page (hero section)
- Product Hunt launch
- Twitter/X posts
- Cold outreach emails
- Onboarding flow
- Documentation

Create once, distribute everywhere. Adapt length/format per channel.

**Cross-platform workflow:**

1. Create master version (neutral style)
2. B站 version: Add personality, Chinese captions, 弹幕 interaction points
3. YouTube version: Tighter edit, SEO optimization, chapters
4. Shorts/竖屏: Extract 60s highlights

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                 | Fix                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Weak hook               | Show result or pain in first 3 seconds               |
| No captions             | 83% watch muted - captions are mandatory             |
| Feature dump            | Focus on 3-5 benefits, not all features              |
| Generic thumbnail       | Face + 3 words + high contrast                       |
| Same for both platforms | Adapt pacing, style, and metadata                    |
| Marketing speak         | Talk like a builder, be honest about tradeoffs       |
| Ignoring long-tail      | Content keeps working for months - invest in quality |
| No tracking             | Can't improve what you don't measure                 |
| Cluttered background    | Distracts before message lands - clean your frame    |
| One-and-done            | Iterate based on drop-off data                       |
