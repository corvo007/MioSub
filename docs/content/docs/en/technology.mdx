MioSub's subtitle generation engine and editor are built from scratch, optimized for AI-powered subtitle workflows.

## Subtitle Generation Engine

### Automatic Terminology Extraction

The problem with traditional machine translation: inconsistent proper noun translations — "東京" becomes "Tokyo" in one place and "Dongjing" in another.

**MioSub's approach:**
- Intelligently extract proper nouns from audio (names, places, titles, etc.)
- Verify standard translations via search engines
- Generate a glossary for consistent terminology throughout the video

### Long-Context Translation

Traditional MT processes sentence by sentence, losing context and meaning.

**MioSub's approach:**
- Segment by semantics into 5-10 minute chunks
- Preserve full context for translation, understanding speaker intent
- Support scene presets (anime, film, news, tech) for optimized translation style

### Post-Transcription Processing

Raw Whisper output has issues with sentence segmentation and timing accuracy.

**MioSub's approach:**
- **Smart segmentation**: Auto-split subtitles based on semantics and pauses
- **Timeline correction**: Fix timing drift in Whisper output
- **Terminology replacement**: Auto-apply glossary for consistent translations

### CTC Forced Alignment

High-precision timeline alignment based on CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) technology.

- Millisecond-level character alignment
- Built-in aligner in v3.0, works out of the box
- Auto-downloads model on first use

### Speaker Identification

Automatically identify and label speakers in multi-person conversations.

- LLM-based speaker inference
- Customizable speaker names and colors
- Merge adjacent subtitles from the same speaker

### Smart Concurrency Control

Dynamically adjust concurrency based on model to maximize speed while avoiding rate limits:

| Model | Concurrency | Strategy |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Gemini Flash | 5 | Speed priority |
| Gemini Pro | 2 | Avoid rate limits |

**Result**: 30-minute video processed in ~8-10 minutes.

## Fully Automated Pipeline

Paste a video link (YouTube/Bilibili), and the entire workflow runs automatically:

1. **Auto Download** — yt-dlp fetches the best quality video
2. **Audio Extraction** — Extract audio and perform VAD segmentation
3. **Smart Transcription** — Whisper speech-to-text
4. **AI Translation & Polish** — Gemini context-aware translation and refinement
5. **Auto Hardcoding** — FFmpeg burns bilingual subtitles (GPU acceleration supported)
6. **Output** — Ready-to-share MP4 with hardcoded subtitles

## Subtitle Editor

### Real-Time Preview

- Built-in assjs rendering engine for accurate font, color, and position rendering
- WYSIWYG — edit and preview simultaneously
- One-click toggle between source and translated text for quick review

### Smart Caching

- Efficient transcoding cache for smooth playback
- Audio-only file support with adaptive player UI

### Batch Operations

- **Batch Regenerate**: Re-run the full pipeline on selected segments (transcription → polish → align → translate)
- **Polish Translation**: Optimize translation quality for selected segments while maintaining context
- Auto-save snapshots before operations, rollback anytime

### Version Management

- Auto-save edit history
- Snapshot rollback support
- Prevent accidental work loss
