## 🎬 Video Processing

### Video download fails?

**Common causes**:
- **Network issues**: Ensure access to YouTube/Bilibili
- **Wrong link format**: Use single video links, not playlists
- **Copyright restrictions**: B站 anime, paid content cannot be downloaded

**Solutions**:
1. Check network connection
2. Use individual video links (not playlists)

---

### Processing is slow?

**Possible causes**:
- Using CPU-only Whisper (slower)
- Network latency affecting API calls

**Optimization tips**:
1. Use smaller Whisper models (Base or Small)
2. [Configure GPU acceleration](/en/docs/guide/whisper)
3. Use Whisper API instead of local models

## 📝 Subtitle Issues

### Subtitle timing is off?

**Solutions**:
1. Enable [forced alignment](/en/docs/guide/alignment) for millisecond precision
2. Manually adjust timing in the editor
3. Check if source video audio has issues

---

### Translation quality not ideal?

**Tips**:
1. **Choose correct scene preset**: Anime, movie, tech, etc.
2. **Use glossary**: Ensures consistent terminology
3. **Try polish feature**: Select subtitles and use "Polish Translation"

## 🖥️ Software Usage

### App won't open / crashes?

1. Confirm you're on Windows 10 or later
2. Try running as administrator

2. Download the latest version
3. Simply overwrite the old version

## v3.0 Specific

### Settings lost after upgrading from v2.x?

v3.0 config file location may have changed. See the [Migration Guide](/en/docs/guide/migration) for manual migration steps.

### Where to download macOS/Linux versions?

v3.0 adds macOS and Linux support. Download from [Releases page](https://github.com/corvo007/Gemini-Subtitle-Pro/releases):
- macOS: `.dmg` files
- Linux: `.AppImage` files

### macOS shows "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified" or "This computer can't read the disk you attached"?

This is a macOS Gatekeeper security warning. Since MioSub is open-source software, we haven't purchased an Apple Developer certificate for code signing.

**Method 1: Right-click to Open (Recommended)**

1. Find MioSub.app in Finder
2. Hold **Control** and click the app icon (or right-click)
3. Select "Open" from the context menu
4. Click "Open" again in the dialog that appears

After opening once, the system remembers your choice and you can double-click normally.

**Method 2: System Preferences**

1. Try to open the app (it will be blocked)
2. Open "System Preferences" > "Security & Privacy" > "General"
3. You'll see the blocked app at the bottom, click "Open Anyway"

**Method 3: Terminal Command**

Open Terminal and run this command to remove the quarantine attribute:

```bash
# Remove quarantine attribute (recommended)
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/MioSub.app

# Or clear all extended attributes
xattr -cr /Applications/MioSub.app
```

<Callout type="warn" title="Security Note">
  Always download from the [official GitHub Releases](https://github.com/corvo007/Gemini-Subtitle-Pro/releases), not third-party sources, to ensure the software hasn't been tampered with.
