This project supports integrating [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) for completely offline speech transcription.

- **Default Support**: The installer includes CPU version Whisper core components (`whisper-cli.exe`)
- **Manual Download Required**: You need to download model files (`.bin`) yourself
- **GPU Acceleration**: You can manually replace with GPU version components for faster speed

## 📦 Model Download Guide

### Recommended Downloads

Download **standard** models with filename format `ggml-[model].bin`:

| Model        | Filename            | Size   | Memory  | Speed  | Use Case         |
| :----------- | :------------------ | :----- | :------ | :----- | :--------------- |
| **Tiny**     | `ggml-tiny.bin`     | 75 MB  | ~390 MB | Fastest | Quick testing    |
| **Base**     | `ggml-base.bin`     | 142 MB | ~500 MB | Fast   | Daily conversation ⭐ |
| **Small**    | `ggml-small.bin`    | 466 MB | ~1 GB   | Medium | Podcasts/Videos ⭐ |
| **Medium**   | `ggml-medium.bin`   | 1.5 GB | ~2.6 GB | Slow   | Complex audio    |
| **Large-v3** | `ggml-large-v3.bin` | 2.9 GB | ~4.7 GB | Slowest | Professional needs |

### Filename Suffix Explanation

- **`.en` (e.g., `ggml-base.en.bin`)**: **English-only** model. More accurate than multilingual models for English-only content, but **does not support** Chinese or other languages.
- **`q5_0`, `q8_0` (e.g., `ggml-base-q5_0.bin`)**: **Quantized** models. Smaller size, faster speed, but slightly reduced accuracy.
  - `q8_0`: Nearly lossless, recommended.
  - `q5_0`: Slight accuracy loss, significantly smaller size.
- **`.mlmodelc.zip`**: ❌ **Do not download**. This is macOS CoreML format, not usable on Windows.

2. Extract the archive
3. Settings > Services > Speech Recognition > "Local Whisper" > "Whisper-cli.exe Path" > "Browse" and select the extracted `whisper-cli.exe`
4. Start using

## ❓ FAQ

- **Can't find the option?** Make sure you're using the **desktop version** — web version doesn't support this feature
- **Status error?** Check if you've correctly selected a `.bin` model file
- **Too slow?** CPU mode speed depends on processor performance. Consider using `Base` or `Small` models
