## ⚡ Quick Setup (v3.0+)

v3.0 has a built-in CTC aligner. Simply:

1. Open **Settings > Enhancement > Timeline Alignment**
2. Set **Alignment Mode** to "CTC"
3. Download the alignment model
4. Set the model directory in CTC aligner configuration to the model path (folder)

## 🎯 How It Works

High-precision timeline alignment based on CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) technology:

- **Millisecond Precision**: Supports character-level timestamp alignment
- **Auto Correction**: Fixes timing drift in Whisper transcription
- **Multi-Language Support**: Supports Chinese, English, Japanese, and more
- **GPU Acceleration**: Supports ONNX Runtime GPU acceleration (if available)

## ❓ FAQ

### Alignment is slow?

CTC alignment requires computational resources. Optimization tips:
1. Ensure sufficient memory (16GB+ recommended)
2. For long videos, alignment is processed in segments

### Alignment makes timing worse?

This can happen if the source video has poor audio quality, or the alignment model isn't optimized for the specific language/accent. Suggestions:
1. Check the source video audio quality
2. Temporarily disable alignment and use the original timestamps
