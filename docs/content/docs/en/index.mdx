import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

<Callout type="info" title="v3.0 Just Launched">
  Brand new AI translation engine — now with Gemini 2.5 Flash, long context windows, and smart glossary extraction.
</Callout>

## Why We Built MioSub

We believe **language barriers shouldn't exist in a connected world**.

But reality says otherwise:

- Traditional subtitle tools are cold and mechanical — that's "machine translation," not "human understanding"
- Hours wasted fixing line-by-line machine translations
- Character names inconsistent — "John" becomes "Jon" becomes "Juan"
- Timing always off, dialogue lagging behind the action

**MioSub was born to change this.**

We combined the **speed** of generative AI with the **depth** of context awareness. It doesn't just translate words — it **understands the story**. It turns "subtitling" from a tedious chore into a smooth creative flow.

> **Make the world's content yours.**
